# Meridian-Fan-Site
Meridian 59 Fansite Theme and gulp / SCSS files

This theme is for WordPress and should work with any version of WordPress 4.x.

I have zipped the uploads folder which contains a lot of the in game images.

This project is not a download and run project, but rather it will have all the files you need to drop into an already working version of WordPress except for some minor configuration.

I am taking a break from this project for a while as the community response to it was pretty poor. I had suspected 103 would want a more up to date fan site, but the only response I received was, "there is a wiki". That wiki is no where near complete and, imo, not as user friendly. O well!
